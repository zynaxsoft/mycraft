# Mycraft

A custom Minecraft server written in Rust from scratch driven by `async_std`. The main purpose of this project
is to teach myself an example of how game server and client interact and how the server is made.

The sub-goal of this project is to make it as a framework such that other people can build a ground-up
bare-bone custom Minecraft server.

Any suggestions and feedback is very welcome.

Login to the server is possible, however it is not possible to do anything.

# Acknowledgement

All of the knowledge thanks to the wonderful Minecraft protocol [wiki page](https://wiki.vg/Main_Page).

Got some hint from [feather-rs](https://github.com/feather-rs).
